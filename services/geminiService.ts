I am an innovator working in the following domain:
"${data.domain}"

The primary thing I feel is missing for my innovation to be fully realized is:
"${data.missingPiece}"

The support and resources that would help me bridge this gap are:
"${data.supportNeeded}"

Based on this information, please generate an "Innovator's Blueprint" for me. The blueprint should be encouraging and actionable. Structure it with the following markdown sections:

### ðŸ’¡ Core Innovation Analysis
Briefly synthesize my domain and its potential significance. Frame it in a positive and empowering light.

### ðŸš§ The Critical Gap
Analyze the "one thing missing." Is it a technological hurdle, a market-fit issue, a resource constraint, or a perception problem? Offer a nuanced perspective on this bottleneck.

### ðŸš€ Strategic Support Roadmap
Based on the requested support, create a bulleted list of concrete, actionable steps. Break down the "support needed" into a practical roadmap.

### âœ¨ Path Forward
Conclude with a motivating summary that reaffirms the value of my work and encourages me to take the first step from the roadmap.
